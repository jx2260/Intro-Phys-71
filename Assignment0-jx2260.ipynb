Try getting help using this approach for the following functions: `print`, `input`, and `open`.  Click the `x` to close the help documentation once you're done scrolling through it.  If you're already familiar with reading [API documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface), you may notice some interesting features of these functions.

And don't worry if the documentation seems inscrutible right now.  As you learn more about Python programming you'll start to build up a sense of the contexts in which different parts of the documentation apply, and you'll also build up a vocabulary that will allow you to communicate (e.g., by reading and writing documentation asking questions, etc.) with other programmers.
